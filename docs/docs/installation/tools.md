## VS Code Extension

Search for "Minot" in your editor an install the package. Running it will require a Minot binary in your `$PATH`. The extension will add syntax highlighting for `.mt` files and automatically activates as soon as you open a Minot file. You will see some buttons in the editor footer.

Select some lines and run them with `Run Selection` or use the Command Palette <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> and type "minot" to also see their keybindings.

## Tree-sitter Syntax Highlighting

Minot comes with Tree-sitter syntax for highlighting outside of VS Code. See [this repository](https://codeberg.org/stelzo/tree-sitter-minot) for instructions on how to add Minot support to the Helix editor or use the repository for other editors that support Tree-sitter grammars.
